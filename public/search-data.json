In the spiritual tradition of India, the credit for spreading the knowledge of Kriya Yoga to the people goes to Mahayogi Guru Gorakhnath and the Nath Yogis. Considered a Yug-Pravartak saint, Mahayogi Gorakhnath was the forerunner of social change in India, offering a unique formula of health and worship alongside purification of the human body, mind, brain, and soul. The Nathpanth, promoted by Guru Shri Gorakhnath, guides Nishkam Karmayoga, viewing service dedicated to people‚Äôs welfare as a spiritual practice. Shri Gorakhnath Temple is the place of penance of Mahayogi Shri Gorakhnath Ji. It is widely believed that the Mahant of Shri Gorakhnath Temple and Shri Gorakshapeeth is the representative of Guru Shri Gorakhnath Ji. Since the time of this Yug-Pravartak Mahayogi, the temple‚Äôs philanthropic role has been expanding. In the modern era, Brahmaleen Mahant Digvijainath Ji Maharaj integrated education and medicine into this service. The establishment of Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad in 1932 marked the beginning of this ideological movement. Brahmaleen Mahant Digvijainath Ji Maharaj founded educational institutions from primary to higher education and paved the way for the establishment of Gorakhpur University. Continuing this legacy, Brahmaleen Mahant Avedyanath Ji Maharaj laid the foundation for significant contributions to allopathic medicine through the establishment of the Guru Shri Gorakshnath Chikitsalaya Samiti. The founding of Guru Shri Gorakshnath Chikitsalaya, following the Digvijainath Ayurvedic College and Digvijainath Ayurvedic Chikitsalaya, was a key milestone in healthcare service in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. Mahayogi Shri Gorakhnath‚Äôs legacy of social service and upliftment of the downtrodden continues to grow through the establishment of Mahayogi Gorakhnath University, Gorakhpur. This revolutionary academic endeavor merges yoga, Ayurveda, medical education, humanities, physical sciences, technical education, skill development, and vocational courses, aiming to revolutionize education and healthcare infrastructure in this historically underserved region. Vision and Aim of Mahayogi Gorakhnath University\nDevelop a world-class modern institution with state-of-the-art technology, facilities, and infrastructure, maintaining the highest standards in education across humanities, physical sciences, technology, medical fields, healthcare, agriculture, and skill development.\nEstablish institutions spanning all genres of medicine ‚Äî from conventional to modern ‚Äî engaged in research, development, technical education, and vocational skills, focused on local resources and needs.\nEncourage study and research in both ancient and modern streams of theoretical and practical knowledge related to education and health.\nBuild healthcare institutions and hospitals for allopathy, yoga, Ayurveda, etc., within a single campus, combining teaching, research, and affordable advanced healthcare services for the local community.\nPromote research, training, and propagation of modern medicine such as allopathy and its related streams.\nDevelop teaching, training, and research programs in nursing, pharmacy, paramedical, and other healthcare-related fields.\nImplement specialized curricula aimed at improving health services and employment opportunities for the local population.\nPrepare curricula related to highly specialized branches of medical studies and encourage further research and development in these areas.\nEstablish institutions connected to social welfare and health programs in remote rural areas of the region."

As the torchbearer of Dharma, he stood as the ultimate symbol of self-discipline, justice, and duty-bound leadership. His life is a guiding light for all who aspire to walk the path of truth and virtue. ‚Äò‡§ú‡§®‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§¶‡§™‡§ø ‡§ó‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§∏‡•Ä‚Äô This ever-inspiring exclamation by Lord Sri Ram reflects his supreme devotion to his motherland and righteousness. He chose exile over throne, duty over comfort, and honor over convenience, setting an eternal example of what it means to lead with moral clarity and sacrifice. Lord Ram's reign ‚Äî Ram Rajya ‚Äî has become a benchmark for just governance, where truth, fairness, and compassion prevailed. He taught the world that power must always be guided by responsibility, and decisions must always align with Dharma. His life reminds us that strength is not in wealth or weapons, but in character, courage, and conviction. In a world where temptations often cloud judgment, Lord Ram's life urges us to rise above self-interest, uphold truth, and live with dignity, compassion, and responsibility. He is not just a historical figure; he is a timeless ideal ‚Äî a living conscience for a society striving toward spiritual strength, unity, and ethical prosperity. Maharana Pratap Ji Maharana Pratap Ji was one of the unparalleled warriors of medieval Bharat. Veer Shiromani Maharana Pratap sacrificed everything for sovereignty, self-pride, religion, and motherland.

The Parishad ensures that youngsters studying in our institutions obtain up-to-date, systematic, and employment-oriented knowledge in their chosen disciplines ‚Äî science, arts, and beyond. We use modern teaching aids and methods to make students self-reliant, employable, and confident individuals. At the same time, it is our mission to instill in them high moral and ethical values so they can serve society with integrity, dedication, and devotion."
